MySQL ASCII Graph 

Graphical pager for MySQL that let you easily visualize data 
straight from the database.

For usage see the examples below



Examples:
# mysql -p
mysql> \P /root/mysqlasciigraph.php
mysql> select value as y from test order by id desc limit 500;
   [You should see the output of the graph]

mysql> select value as y, id as x from test order by id desc limit 500;
   [You should see the output of the graph]


Reversing graph values, useful when data comes in reversed order and 
you do not want to use ORDER BY 

mysql> \P /root/mysqlasciigraph.php reverse 
mysql> select value as y from test order by id desc limit 500;
   [You should see the output of the graph]

OR specify an extra column "reverse"

mysql> select value as y, 'yes' as reverse from test order by id desc limit 500;
   [You should see the output of the graph]


If you select values for X axis as well and there are gaps in your 
data set, you will see gaps on the graph as well
mysql> select value as y, id as x from test where (id > 300 or id < 100) and id < 500;
   [You should see the output of the graph]

Dealing with datetime/timestamp fields on the X axis
mysql> \P /root/mysqlasciigraph.php date reverse
mysql> select value as y, runtimestamp as x from test where (id > 300 or id < 100) and id < 500;
   [You should see the output of the graph]
